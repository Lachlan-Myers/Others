How to execute
--------------
Having never opened it on a computer without Visual Studio 2010 installed, I presume that the program should execute by double clicking on the ConsoleApplication2 application located in ConsoleApplication2\bin\Debug\ConsoleApplication2.exe.


Thoughts
--------
- The code appears slightly messy, however it should still be readible and able to follow the logic.
- Not all errors are caught, such as if you don't type anything and hit enter nothing happens.
- There is no 'Back' option, however upon completing the desired task the program goes back to the main menu and will continue to do so until the 'Exit' option is chosen.
- Some information may appear to be presented it a messy fashion. This is due to my resolution and command line screen being set to a large format. It is also due to the amount of information being presented in order for the user to make an informed decsion.
- No information is stored in a file. It is all stored in a data structure.
- some lines may be commented out. This is due to me forgetting to delete the lines and should be ignored.

- System does not enforce any security. There is no login/password required to access the software.
- System does not generate any alerts if a member is not returning any items. This is due to there not being a return system just yet.
- System does not maintain an inventory. There are Items already added this is so you can see that data is properly kept.
- System does not handle data security and backup.

Thank you.
